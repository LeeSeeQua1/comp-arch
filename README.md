Computer architecture assignments

## Fixed-floating
This program designed to perform arithmetic operations with fractional numbers in fixed-point and floating-point formats. It utilizes integer computations and data types exclusively

## Cache
The program aims to emulate the functionality of a CPU cache and evaluate its performance under different replacement policies. It specifically implements the LRU and Bit-pLRU algorithms to manage cache entries effectively

## Disassembler
This program designed to assist in reverse engineering or analyzing binary executables by providing a readable representation of the machine code. It parses the binary instructions, decodes them, and outputs the corresponding assembly language instructions

## Omp
The program uses multi-threading with OpenMP library to efficiently compute volume of a tetrahedron using Monte-Carlo simulation. The schedule parameters were chosen based on the comparison by performance
